###Questions
- Ask for project specifications (lost them) - check email
- Are we testing for cryptographic or Simulation RNGs? - simulation RNG, preferrably not TRNG because wanna rerun simulation to check 
- Any useful lectures/lecture slides from high performance computing or DSD? - not really

###Next steps
- Discuss simple statistical model tests performed
  - Histogram
- Discuss papers read
  - Central Limit Theorem increasing usefulness of Normal Distribution - yep
- Discuss MSc university references
- memory mapping of histogram
  - keep things inside Vivado as simple as possible and outsource complexity to software
  - consider ap_fifo as decoupling mechanism between arbitrary RNG and the stats tests
  - study hls_stream library
  - consider parallelism of block components (e.g. "tee" duplicate input stream and analyse seperately)
    - speed will be slowed down to the slowest component's speed
  - keep random numbers data type uint<32> (or ap_fixed)
    - interface for hls_stream, 32-bit
      - advantages of using FIFO-based interface
  - advanced:
    - take tuples of 32-bit input, output 64-bit
    - LFSR -> can take regularity of rank of matrix to test for arndomness
    - consider batching, i.e. intermediate statistics feeding back the progress of data
    - visualisation: can use Matlab or Python-based plotting (3d) to communicate in report
  - study bin, normal, p-value, cdf, pdf relationship
  - why chose bare metal vs linux on ARM processor? - too complex!
  - study address bus vs stream (one-to-one)
  - output values interesting to consumer, e.g. thresholds, p-values, other inputs to statistical tests, etc.
