- consider TestU01 benchmarking (maybe take max of both test durations, assuming possible multi-core implementation)- justify comparisons made with own reasoning - put in figures of how many times it's faster
- include numbers how much better product is in abstract
- be direct in report that I've done things and not just "there is", as it's not straightforward (wording how?)

- Introduction: simply point forward to background of outlining motivations
- briefly mention how problem was solved (methodologically) and why

Requirements Capture (what a solution should look like)
- should give reader an 

Top Level Abstract Design - show not that I know how to build things, but also that I can design it
- how is way things are structured in this section help meet the requirements specified in section before
- how system make it easy to add / remove tests?
- how system makes it easy that software can take away parts of computation from hardware?
- explain how output streams are a flow that can be captured and analysed to test design's functional test
	- functional testing (individual components working as 	intended?)
	- integration testing (hw/sw interaction correct?)

- merge low level abstract design / implementation sections
- test flows should be discussed in top level abstract design
- mentioned problems faced and how they were overcome at the relevant level of abstraction
- where algorithms are mentioned and whether they're mentioned twice is flexible

- evaluation section: demonstrate that functional requiremnts set earlier have been met

- evaluation and future work and conclusion - be reflective (opportunities that arose whilst implementing the project0

- appendix - example output
- appendix - user guide numbered instructions 1 page-ish
