#Interim report
- Project Specification
- Background
- Detailed goals (given the above background, this is what the project wants to achieve)
- Implementation plan
  - (discuss what has been done already / uncertainties at this point in the project)
  - include discussion on anticipated risks (e.g. running out of space/resources on FPGA, etc.)
- Evaluation plan (this section requires sufficient granularity and precision
  - discussion that RNGs can be put into three bukets, definitely going to fail, definitely going to pass, and grey zone

###Background
- what is p-value, overview of Diehard and TestU01
- go a bit deeper into intermediate statistical tests
  - read literature about Diehard, TestU01 for documentation on disasters (make briefly clear in report why they can go wrong
  - read about non-RNGness for Monte-Carlo simulations
- why this project implementation? a) extremely large numbers b) this is in hardware

###Detailed goals
Phrasing of performance goals (split into musts and shoulds)
- Aim for 2^38 numbers put through (based on te maximum throughput of TestU01 in software)
- Maybe 2^44 or 2^48 depending on how much progress has been made at this point
- 10 million samples
- 100 million samples/second
- must: one DieHard test required to be implemented
- should: e.g. 4 of them in parallel

#Other matters
- in conclusion of actual report, talk about how Verilog-level implementation would be better (speed, better logic, etc.)
- full evaluation is testing of actual chunks of data over hours and hours of simulation on the FPGA
- request Zedboard
