Next meeting Friday 15 Apr 2016 2pm

- for software/hardware interfacing, consider using UART interface
- lab book should not be necessary as project is more Computing in nature, GitHub should suffice
- Theory behind embarrassingly parallel Monte Carlo simulations -> in report, explain terms like these only briefly, e.g. one sentence
  - independent processes should be run in parallel whenever possible
- problems with quasi-random: the latter numbers correlate stronger with existing numbers
- PhD students doing Vivado HLS-related things -> probably not as more independent work is marked better, but maybe later
- nonuniformly distributed vs uniformly distributed - nonuniform is not in scope of the project
- sequences generated used further in FPGA? yes, Monte Carlo simulation would be implemented in position of the RNG tests (RNG tests can be regarded as a kind of Monte Carlo simulation)
- Audience of report - not just DT but also a random somewhat knowledgeable academic (if they learn something new through report, that's good)
