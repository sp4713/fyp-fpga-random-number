- Unfortunately the implementations of the most popular batteries of test suites are not focused on efficiency and high performance, do not benefit of the processing power offered by todayâ€™s multi-core processors and tend to become bottlenecks in the processing of large volumes of data generated by various random number generators.
- Parallel version of TestU01 test suite intends to fill this need, however reduces only by a factor of 4
- Need to read in study or elsewhere how fast TestU01 is atm
